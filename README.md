## problem

### motivation

- it's hard to share journal prompts with others (or find new ones)
- community-driven -> you can fork to translate or add your own twist
- it's form-like so easy to fill out. you can do it right on the site
- entire site is open-source, both tech and content

### why not just a notion template?

- it's quite difficult to fork
- not everybody uses notion <- the most important barrier, actually
